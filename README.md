This is a template for Python Projects in Goldenberg Lab. To use this template, please

1. Download Anaconda.
2. Create a virtual environment.
3. Within the virtual environment, update the requirements.txt to contain all the necessary packages for your project.
4. Designate your folders. We have provided a `processing` and `analysis` folder, but we recognize that your purposes for working in Python might be different.
